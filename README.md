# 12-Web-Scraping-and-Document-Databases homework
For this assignment, I wound up doing a lot of commenting out and trying again. If I missed a comment here and there, that's why. I tried to clean it up best I could to keep it functional.
Missing class is also quite the terrible idea.
I tried to make the text in the final app white, but ultimately gave up when everything I tried managed to screw up functionality. You can still read it.
